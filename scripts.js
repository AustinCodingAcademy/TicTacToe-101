// this "handleClick" function is called when a box is clicked. Here, "element" will hold the same value as "this" does in the HTML. 
// "this" is a special word in JS but "element" could have been "thing" or "el" or whatever we wanted it to be as long as we use it again in the "console.log" statement

  // this uses the "log" method on the "console" to log out the element's id so we can see it with our human eyes
  console.log(`The element you clicked on has an id:  ${element.id}`)

  // this next line prevents an X being changed to an O or an O being changed to an X by...
  //  checking to see if the square clicked has anything in it, if not continue
